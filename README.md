## About Me

Hello, My name is Priya Chhabra and I am based in Delhi, India.After completing my schooling from CBSE in Commerce field. 
I was unsure which path I needed to take. I quickly realized that Accounts is something which I was not interested at the moment I opted for BCA from Indira Gandhi National Open University while doing a job.

Although, I was always interested in Computers and the Web. I thought that I might be able to make a decent career out of this. However, that didn’t happen.

I applied for a job as a Customer Service representative to support my family. And I quickly realized that pursuing an education while doing a job is not as easy as it seems. No guide tells how you can manage both together.

Fast forward to 2020, in January I was excited and I had made plans what I will do for the rest of the year and how I’ll manage everything.

Than COVID-19 happened, I realized that all the planning that I have done is useless and my future looks quite uncertain which was not something I expected after working for 5 years.

I was informed by the Company that due to the existing situation, I will be redeployed to the new process in April. But that didn’t happen. I waited for more than 1.5 months and on the 8th of June, I was informed by my company that I was temporarily being laid off from work for 9 weeks. Meanwhile, they will try to find a new position for me matching my skillset.

After receiving this call, I was shattered as I know how much effort I have put in my work and this is the result that I’m getting. 

It made me wonder how easy it is for the company to let go of employees who are loyal to them.

After 9 weeks, I received another call from HR stating that my layoff has been extended until further notice and they are waiting for work to pick up in my existing process so that they can reabsorb me or redeploy me. 

I know few things are uncleared but I will clear everything soon !....
